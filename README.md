## 📂 Dataset Overview

The app uses the **Heart Disease Dataset**

Each row represents a patient and contains 13 features + 1 target value.

### Key Features:
- **age**: Age in years
- **sex**: Gender (0 = female, 1 = male)
- **cp**: Chest pain type (0 = typical angina, ..., 3 = asymptomatic)
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
- **restecg**: ECG results (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal, 2 = hypertrophy)
- **thalach**: Max heart rate achieved
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **oldpeak**: ST depression relative to rest
- **slope**: Slope of ST segment (0 = up, 1 = flat, 2 = down)
- **ca**: Number of major vessels (0-3)
- **thal**: Thalassemia type (1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect)

### Target:
- `0` → No heart disease  
- `1` → Heart disease present
